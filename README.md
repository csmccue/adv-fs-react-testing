# React Testing Solution

This is the template for the React testing assignment. The assignment's domain
is a shopping list.

## Components

There will be pre-existing components that only need tests written for them:
1. `ShoppingLists`
2. `ShoppingList`
3. `ShoppingListForm`

New components will need to be written, along with their tests:
1. `ShoppingListItem`
2. `ShoppingListItemForm`

The `ConfirmationButton` has tests that demonstrate its usage and prove its
functionality.
